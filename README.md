# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to predict a persons income is less then or greater than $50,000 a year 

# Data Source
The dataset that was used for this project can be downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult

# Data
Attributes
- age
- workclass
- fnlwgt
- education
- education-num
- marital-status
- relationship
- race
- sex
- capital-gain
- capital-loss
- hours-per-week
- native-country
- income
  
# Processing
After downloading this dataset, a test print was conducted using the following piece of code ```data.head()```, ```data.info()```.  The loaded data was then displayed. A check was done to find missing values in the dataframe using the following piece of code ```missing_values = data.isnull().sum()```. This found no missing values in the dataset. Striped any white spaces. Binary indicator columns were created for capital gain and capital loss, marking whether a person had any gain or loss. Additionally, a log transformation was applied to both capital gain and loss values to reduce skewness. One hot encoding was then done on the following columns ```workclass```, ```education```, ```marital-status```, ```occupation```, ```relationship```, ```race```, ```sex```, ```native-country```. The data was then split into features and target variable ```income```. Data was then split into training and testing set 70% training and 30% testing.

# Data Understanding and Visualisation 
After processing the data and fitting it to the Gaussian Bayes and MultiNomial Bayes the classifcation report and the confusion matrix were created.
